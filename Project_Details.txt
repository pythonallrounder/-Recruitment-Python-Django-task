We’d like you to build a simple REST API for us - a basic movie database interacting with an external API. Here’s the full specification of endpoints that we’d like it to have:

POST /movies:
The request body should contain only the movie title, and its presence should be validated.
Based on the passed title, other movie details should be fetched from http://www.omdbapi.com/ (or other similar, public movie database) - and saved to the application database.
Request response should include a complete movie object and all data fetched from external API.
GET /movies:
Should fetch a list of all movies already present in the application database.
Additional filtering and sorting are optional, but some implementation is a bonus.
POST /comments:
The request body should contain the ID of the movie already present in the database and the comment text body.
Comment should be saved to the application database and returned in the request-response.
GET /comments:
Should fetch a list of all comments present in the application database.
Should allow filtering comments by associated movie, bypassing its ID.
